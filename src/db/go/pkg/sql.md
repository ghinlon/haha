# Overview

Go provides three different methods for executing database queries:

* `DB.Query()` is used for SELECT queries which return multiple rows.
* `DB.QueryRow()` is used for SELECT queries which return a single row.
* `DB.Exec()` is used for statements which donâ€™t return rows (like INSERT and DELETE).
