```
[Verse 1: Elayna Boynton]
Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders
Pressure to break or retreat at every turn
Facing the fear that the truth, I discovered
No telling how, all these will work out
But I've come to far to go back now

[Chorus: Elayna Boynton]
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
I know all too well it don’t come easy
The chains of the world they seem to moving tight
I try to walk around if I’m stumbling so come..
Trying to get up but the doubt is so strong
There’s gotta be a winning in my bones

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & Elayna Boynton]
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

[Verse 3: Elayna Boynton & Anthony Hamilton]
Oh not giving up there’s always been hard, so hard
But if I do the things the easy way I won’t get far
Mhm, life hasn't been very kind to me lately, (Well)
But I suppose it’s a push for moving on (Oh yeah)
In time the sun’s gonna shine on me nicely (On me yeah)
Something tells me good things are coming and I ain’t gonna not believe

[Chorus: Elayna Boynton & Anthony Hamilton]
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have
