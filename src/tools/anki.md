There are two simple concepts behind Anki: active recall testing and spaced
repetition. 

**Active Recall Testing**

**Active recall testing** means being asked a question and trying to remember the
answer. This is in contrast to **passive study**, where we read, watch or listen to
something without pausing to consider if we know the answer. Research has shown
that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories
than passive study. 


The brain’s **“use it or lose it”** policy applies to everything we learn. If you
spend an afternoon memorizing some science terms, and then don’t think about
that material for two weeks, you’ll probably have forgotten most of it. In
fact, studies show we forget about 75% of material learnt within a 48 hour
period. This can seem pretty depressing when you need to learn a lot of
information.

The solution is simple, however: **review**. By reviewing newly-learnt information,
we can greatly reduce forgetting.

**Spaced Repetition**

The spacing effect was reported by a German psychologist in 1885. He observed
that we tend to remember things more effectively if we spread reviews out over
time, instead of studying multiple times in one session. Since the 1930s there
have been a number of proposals for utilizing the spacing effect to improve
learning, in what has come to be called spaced repetition.


**Notes & Fields**

When making flashcards, it’s often desirable to make more than one card that
relates to some information. For example, if you’re learning French, and you
learn that the word “bonjour” means “hello”, you may wish to create one card
that shows you “bonjour” and asks you to remember “hello”, and another card
that shows you “hello” and asks you to remember “bonjour”. One card is testing
your ability to recognize the foreign word, and the other card is testing your
ability to produce it.


**Note Types**


Basic (and reversed card)

    Like Basic, but creates two cards for the text you enter: one from front→
    back and one from back→front.

# Studying

On the decks screen, your decks will be displayed in a list. There are two
number columns, due and new. Due is the count of waiting reviews and cards
currently in learning. New is the number of new cards that are ready to be
learnt that day.
