Vrnetlab, or VR Network Lab, is an open-source network emulator that runs
virtual routers using KVM and Docker. Software developers and network engineers
use vrnetlab, along with continuous-integration processes, for testing network
provisioning changes in a virtual network. Researchers and engineers may also
use the vrnetlab command line interface to create and modify network emulation
labs in an interactive way.
