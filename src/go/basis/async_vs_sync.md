* [Asynchronous vs synchronous execution, what does it really mean? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/748235)


Synchronous/Asynchronous **HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MULTI-THREADING.**

Synchronous, or Synchronized means "connected", or "dependent" in some way. In
other words, two synchronous tasks must be aware of one another, and one task
must execute in some way that is dependent on the other, such as wait to start
until the other task has completed.

Asynchronous means they are totally independent and neither one must consider
the other in any way, either in initiation or in execution.
