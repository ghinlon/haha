Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.17.0.35:6443 --token z36he9.hlio8gqvxognvuuk \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a4f314dd5f59656e0a42699b5ac5ac962e6b29914f4d2b0732d202dd997cf139

// 3
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

// 4
curl https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.9/manifests/calico-typha.yaml -o calico.yaml
kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
```

## On node

```
// 1
node01 $ kubeadm join 172.17.0.35:6443 --token z36he9.hlio8gqvxognvuuk \
>     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a4f314dd5f59656e0a42699b5ac5ac962e6b29914f4d2b0732d202dd997cf139
// output
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks
[preflight] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[preflight] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[kubelet-start] Downloading configuration for the kubelet from the "kubelet-config-1.14" ConfigMap in the kube-system namespace
[kubelet-start] Writing kubelet configuration to file "/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml"

[kubelet-start] Waiting for the kubelet to perform the TLS Bootstrap...

This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the control-plane to see this node join the cluster.
